    "In Tennessee, the number of power outages had spiked to 140,000 Thursday afternoon, many of them near Memphis. Outage numbers were also climbing in Ohio (26,000) and Kentucky (15,000), according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide. The outages were mostly because of ice accumulation.\n",

    "Outage numbers in Texas and Arkansas, which peaked Thursday morning over 70,000 and 25,000, respectively, were slowly declining in the afternoon as freezing rain transitioned more to sleet and snow, which do not accumulate as readily on trees and powerlines. The outage count in Texas had dropped below 50,000.\n",

    "\n",
    "The National Weather Service warned of hazardous road conditions throughout the affected areas, which it said would probably see well-below-average temperatures for at least the next couple of days.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some of the worst conditions were in southwest Tennessee, with over 120,000 power outages reported in Shelby County, home to Memphis. As much as half an inch of ice had accumulated on tree limbs, which were crackling under its weight.\n",

    "“Travel conditions are bad and getting worse” around Cincinnati, where there had been a glaze of ice, the Weather Service tweeted. The ice was anticipated to switch to snow in Cincinnati during the evening.\n",

    "The most substantial icy precipitation will shift from the Tennessee Valley into West Virginia and central Pennsylvania on Thursday night into Friday morning. Pittsburgh and State College, Pa., could see significant icing overnight before precipitation flips to snow. Areas northwest of New York City in the Hudson Valley could see icy conditions Friday morning as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snow should finally end around Little Rock and St. Louis early Thursday evening. However, it will continue well into the overnight hours in southeast Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, Indiana and the northern third of Ohio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extreme northwest Pennsylvania, Upstate New York around the Finger Lakes and the Tug Hill Plateau and Vermont will see snowfall well into Friday. The snow will enter Maine and New Hampshire in northern New England on Thursday afternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heaviest snow totals will be realized just north of the freezing rain and sleet line, with another 6 to 12 inches possible, especially in areas that haven’t seen snow yet into the interior Northeast.\n",
    "\n",
    "The storm’s final act comes Friday in eastern New England, when morning rain will transition to freezing rain, sleet and all snow as temperatures crash into the 20s during the evening. A “flash freeze” overnight into early Saturday will cause any remnant moisture and slushy slop on the roadways to harden and freeze.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power situation in Texas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahead of the storm, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said Wednesday that “no one can guarantee” there would not be power outages during the first significant test of the state’s power grid a year after a historic freeze killed hundreds of residents and left millions without power for days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of outages as of Thursday were “certainly an inconvenience but not that big of a deal in terms of what you might expect from a wind storm and ice storm,” said Michael Webber, an energy resources professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outages last year were driven largely by a “massive imbalance between supply and demand,” he said, but Thursday seemed driven by wind or ice accumulation that can fell trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power at Webber’s home was out but started to return during an interview with The Washington Post.\n",
    "\n",
    "“An outage for two hours — not two and a half days,” he said, underlining the difference from the major storm in 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Texas governor says ‘no one can guarantee’ there won’t be power outages in winter storm\n",
    "\n",
    "Daniel Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston, said Thursday’s outages had been localized, “which anywhere in the world could get when you have an ice storm come through and knock down tree branches and affect local power lines.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahead of the winter storm, Texas’s state grid reported that its electric generation units and transmission facilities had met new standards Webber said such inspections and winterization investments will have already been helpful, “but the system hasn’t really been tested yet.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“This storm will not be as cold for as long across as wide an area as last year,” he said. “So it isn’t the same kind of test. It’s a simpler, milder storm in many ways, and the equipment should be in better shape.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In the coming days, Webber said, it will be helpful to monitor how cold it gets in Houston. The state’s biggest city will largely dictate the level of power demand. He said he is also interested in how gas systems and gas-producing regions hold up to the cold, and how that will affect gas supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohan said he’s watching how the wind farms fare, whether major gas pipelines remain in working order and whether “our old fleet of power plants perform better than they did last year.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“If not too many wind farms ice, gas supply stays adequate and not too many power plants fail in the freeze, then we’ll get through this fine and eke by with just enough supply,” Cohan said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow and ice totals so far\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The snow had already piled up to impressive and disruptive levels through Thursday midday, with dozens of locations logging double-digit accumulations. Leading the pack was Colorado Springs, where 22 inches had piled up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farther east, Chicago was initially predicted to be right on the fringe of snowfall, and the atmosphere delivered — Chicago’s Midway airport tallied 11 inches of snow, while O’Hare International only wound up with 5.6, roughly half that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ice event underway lagged the snow by about 12 hours, meaning totals will increase as Thursday wears on. But some areas have already seen significant icing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to a half-inch of ice was reported in eastern Oklahoma, near the border with Arkansas. Nearly one-quarter inch had accumulated in Fort Smith, Ark.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Texas, the counties of Hunt, Fannin and Collin, north and east of Dallas, reported tree damage from overnight icing, while the Weather Service reported a glaze of around 0.1 inches near Wichita Falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Little Rock had seen more sleet than freezing rain, with the Weather Service reporting 2.5 inches in north Little Rock.\n",
